Created this blog to showcase some of my projects in more detail, mainly will be starting with my home lab setup and the journey to slowly depend less on the Cloud (a.k.a: ‘Someone else’s computer‘) and have some more independence in the services I use, and of course, to ramble about whatever is on my mind.

Let this be a reminder to myself and others that true independence is almost unachievable when using such a huge variety of services and products. Of course your hardware has to come from somewhere and unless we have a warehouse of lots hardware already bought, you would have to replace your current hardware some day, it could be due to damage or plain old age. So in the hardware side we are already missing some independence, yet there are some brave people out there with amazing projects that aim to ‘open source‘ hardware.

In the software side we depend on all these cloud services, whether we realize it or not. Many of which are funnily enough built on top of open standards and technology.

And this is really the key here, as human beings we just cannot function independently, depending on somebody else is not really the problem, it never has been. The real issue is when that dependence turns into something toxic. And that is what open source brings to the table. It is still people (me) depending on others (very talented developers) to make life better for everyone but without having to give our life (data) in exchange. Let’s support source in whichever way we can, be it monetarily, with maintenance, or with code.

None of my projects and my home-lab setup would have been possible without the people who came before, and particularly without those who give to open source.
